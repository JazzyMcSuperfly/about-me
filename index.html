    <h1>GEORGE HOLMES</h1>

    <h2>BIO</h2>

      <p>I was born and raised in the great state of Washington and as a consequence I have a huge appreciation for the outdoors, which is why I've decided to become a programmer! I married my middleschool sweetheart, Kelly, 4 years ago and we both have put lot's of hard work in to make our lives work together in harmony. Part of that harmony comes from a love of animals and as a result, we now have 3 cats: Mo, Ophelia and Potato. I studied philosophy in college and have some pretty bizarre views on the nature of reality and I hope to eventually puncture the very fabric of spacetime with my fabulous JavaScript skillz.</p>
